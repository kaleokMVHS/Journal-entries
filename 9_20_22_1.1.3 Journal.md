* iterator - an object that can be iterated over, as with a for loop

```python
iterator = [1, 2 3]

for num in iterator:
    print(num)

# -> 1 2 3
```

* relational operator - an operator that tests the relationship between two objects. Examples include a "greater than", "less than" or "equal to" relationship. Returns a boolean

```python
print(1 < 2) # -> True
```

* conditional expression - the complete expression of checking the truthiness of a condition

```python
if (1 < 2):
    # do something ...


# This is a conditional expression, which would usually be used to evaluate a variable condition, then choose whether or not to execute the given code.
```

* decidable vs undecidable - decidable problems are problems for which an algorithm can be written that produces a valid output for all inputs. Undecidable problems are problems where such an algorithm cannot be created.

## Conclusion questions

1. You could use the modulo operator to calculate leap years. For example if year % 4 == 0, it is a leap year, if year % 400 == 0, it is not.

2. Reusing existing code makes code more readable and
